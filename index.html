					<h2 class="blogtitle">Email Marketing is a <br/>Directly Marketing</h2>
					</div>
					<br>			  
					<div class="blogdata">A commercial message to a group of people using email. In its broadest sense, every email sent to a potential or current customer could be considered email marketing. It usually involves using email to send ads, request business, or solicit sales or donations, and is meant to build loyalty, trust, or brand awareness. </div>
				
					<div class="blogdata">Email marketing can be done to either sold lists or a current customer database.</div>
	
					<div class="blogdata leftbord">“The term is usually used to refer to sending email messages with the purpose of enhancing the relationship of a merchant with its current or previous customers, to encourage customer loyalty and repeat business, acquiring new customers or convincing current customers to purchase something immediately, and adding advertisements to email messages sent by other companies to their customers.”</div>
	
					<div class="sa2"><div class="blogdata">The primary purpose of a transactional email is to convey information regarding the action that triggered it. But, due to its high open rates, transactional emails are an opportunity to engage customers: to introduce or extend the email relationship with customers or subscribers, to anticipate and answer questions or to cross-sell or up-sell products or services.</div></div>
					
					<div class="sa2"><div class="blogdata">Direct email or interruption based marketing involves sending an email solely to communicate a promotional message (for example, an announcement of a special offer or a catalog of products).</div></div>
					
					<div class="clear"></div>			  
					
					<div class="blogquestion">ADVANTAGES</div>
					<div class="blogdata">An exact return on investment can be tracked ("track to basket") and has proven to be high when done properly. Email marketing is often reported as second only to search marketing as the most effective online marketing tactic. Email marketing is significantly cheaper and faster than traditional mail, mainly because of high cost and time required in a traditional mail campaign for producing the artwork, printing, addressing and mailing.</div>
					
					<div class="blogquestion">DISADVANTAGES</div>
					<div class="blogdata">According to the report, legitimate email servers averaged a delivery rate of 56%; twenty percent of the messages were rejected, and eight percent were filtered. Companies considering the use of an email marketing program must make sure that their program does not violate spam laws such as the United States. </div>

					<h2 class="blogtitle">INDUSTRIAL BROCHURE <br/>DESIGN IDEAS</h2>
					</div>
					<br>			  
					<div class="blogdata">Manufacturers and distributors that sell industrial products to businesses or consumers need attractive brochures that make prospects buy. The process of creating a compelling brochure starts with understanding your target market. </div>
				
					<div class="blogdata">Find out what type of information, benefits and specifications buyers need to know about products to feel confident about making a purchase, and then include those details in the brochure.</div>
	
					<div class="blogdata leftbord">“Industrial design is a process of design applied to products that are to be manufactured through techniques of mass production. ”</div>
	
					<div class="sa2"><div class="blogdata">Its key characteristic is that design is separated from manufacture: the creative act of determining and defining a product's form takes place in advance of the physical act of making a product, which consists purely of repeated, often automated, replication.</div></div>
					
					<div class="sa2"><div class="blogdata">This distinguishes industrial design from craft-based design, where the form of the product is determined by the product's creator at the time of its creation. The nature of this process can take many forms: it can be conducted by an individual or a large team.</div></div>
					
					<div class="clear"></div>			  
					
					<div class="blogquestion">PURPOSE</div>
					<div class="blogdata">Start your brochure design process by identifying the purpose of the piece. If you want to introduce a new product, use bold headlines along with clear images and copy that immediately tells readers that they’re learning about something new and exciting. If your piece is meant to convince people to buy a product that’s been on the market for a while, make your branding, reputation and dedication to customer service part of your marketing message. For instance, mention your company’s expertise in the field or show how your product solves a common problem. If the market calls for it, focus the piece on how you offer low prices or are an industry leader.</div>
					
					<div class="blogquestion">VISUALS AND COPY</div>
					<div class="blogdata">Rather than using long, technical explanations of your product, rely on imagery such as photos, drawings and charts to help prospects visualize what you’re selling. Make sure the visuals help tell the story and don't just fill space. Show how people use your product and arrange a photo shoot to get the pictures, if necessary. Build credibility and show you are a team player by adding photos of your staff.</div>
					
					<div class="blogquestion">FOCUS ON BENEFITS</div>
					<div class="blogdata">The features of your product are important, but so is the way your product benefits the distributor or the end user. Explain these benefits in short paragraphs consisting of just a few sentences each to help prospects understand what your product can do for them or their customers. If you’ve improved your product through a new design or new features, mention these. Explain how you responded to distributor requests to make the product operate easier, more efficiently or faster.</div>
					
					<div class="blogquestion">SIZE</div>
					<div class="blogdata">Many brochures consist of an 8 1/2-by-11-inch piece of paper folded into three sections to fit into a standard business-size envelope. Stand out with an oversized piece, such as a brochure made from an 11-by-17-inch page folded in half or a tall skinny piece, 14 inches long by 4 1/4 inches wide. To add more appeal to the piece, use cut-outs to enhance views of your product. For instance, show the details on a panel of buttons or the inside of an appliance to explain the improvements to the motor.</div>

					<div class="blogdata">It requires a clear idea about the concept and values of the brand as well as understanding of the consumer or target group.

					<h2 class="blogtitle">MODERN DIGITAL  <br/>TYPOGRAPHY SELECTION</h2>
					</div>
					<br>			  
					<div class="blogdata">Modern typography reflected a modern, universal method of communication. This design concept assumes passive, almost automatic - subconscious visual experience. </div>
				
					<div class="blogdata">It counts on rationality of both, graphic designer/producer of the message and the audience that is receiving the message. The act of perception that is involved is simple act of seeing; reader is passive, detached and objective.</div>
	
					<div class="blogdata leftbord">The hallmark of early modern typography is the sans-serif typeface. "Because of its simplicity, the even weight of its lines, and its nicely balanced proportions, sans serif forms pleasing and easily distinguished word patterns — a most important element in legibility and easy reading."</div>

					<div class="clear"></div>	 -->		  
					
					<div class="blogquestion">OBJECTIVE</div>
					<div class="blogdata">The Modern typography states as its first objective to develop its visible form out of the functions of the text. For modernist designers it is essential to give pure and direct expression to the contents of whatever is printed: "Just as in the works of technology and nature, 'form' must be created out of function. Only then can we achieve typography that expresses the spirit of modern man. The function of printed text is communication, emphasis (word value), and the logical sequence of the contents." The trend in modern typography is definitely toward simplicity and legibility, employing forms that comply with the natural inclination of the human eye to seek harmony and ease.</div>
					
					<div class="blogquestion">MODEL OF VISION</div>
					<div class="blogdata">Modern interpretation of the message assumes objectivity and neutrality. Graphic design, processed through print technology, translates problems and experiences into a visual linear order. There is a single point of view. The designer believes that he/she should control what would be seen. This model of vision rejects interplay between a viewer and image and affirms that our internal makeup does not alter the impressions we receive. The modern designer's objective is to control the viewer's detached visual component so that information is transmitted seamlessly.</div>

					<br>			  
					<div class="blogdata">Landing pages are often linked to from social media, email campaigns or search engine marketing campaigns in order to enhance the effectiveness of the advertisements. The general goal of a landing page is to convert site visitors into sales or leads.</div>
				
					<div class="blogdata">If the goal is to obtain a lead, the landing page will include some method for the visitor to get into contact, usually a phone number, or an inquiry form. If a sale is required, the landing page will usually have a link for the visitor to click, which will then send them to a shopping cart or checkout area. </div>
	
					<div class="blogdata leftbord">“In online marketing, a landing page, sometimes known as a "lead capture page" or a "lander", is a single web page that appears in response to clicking on a search engine optimized search result or an online advertisement. The landing page will usually display directed sales copy that is a logical extension of the advertisement, search result or link.”</div>
	
					<div class="sa"><div class="blogdata">By analyzing activity generated by the linked URL, marketers can use click-through rates and conversion rate to determine the success of an advertisement. </div></div>
					
					<div class="sa"><div class="blogdata">The design of the landing page layout matters and this should be tested with different ideas and page layout styles to see what converts and works better. There are two types of landing pages: Reference and Transactional.</div></div>

					<div class="blogquestion">REFERENCE LANDING PAGE</div>

					<div class="blogquestion">TRANSACTIONAL LANDING PAGES</div>
					<div class="blogdata">The purpose of the transactional landing page is to persuade a visitor to take action by completing a transaction. This is accomplished by providing a form that needs to be filled out. The visitor information is obtained in order to add the visitor’s email address to a mailing list as a prospect. An email campaign can then be developed based on responses to transactional landing pages. The goal is to capture as much information about the visitor as possible. The ultimate goal is to convert the visitor into a customer.</div>

(Previously, a knowledge of such technologies as HTML and FTP had been required to publish content on the Web.) </div>

					<div class="blogdata">A blog can be private, as in most cases, or it can be for business purposes. Blogs used internally to enhance the communication and culture in a corporation or externally for marketing, branding or public relations purposes are called corporate blogs.
